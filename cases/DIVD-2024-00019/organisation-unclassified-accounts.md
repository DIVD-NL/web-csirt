This page is a sub page of the case file for case [DIVD-2025-00019 - Victim Notification Operation Endgame](/DIVD-2029-00019/), which contains the general information about this case.

## Credentials of undetermined origin associated with your organisation were found in a botnet in Operation Endgame

If you received a notification from us with the subject `Stolen credentials found for your organization in Police operation  - DIVD-2024-00019` it means that one or more credentials for email addresses of which the domain is linked to your organisation have been found in a Botnet by the Dutch police.

## What does this mean?

What we know for sure is that combinations of username and passwords that are associated with a domain belonging to your organisation were used by criminals operating a botnet between December 2024 and May 30th 2024. 
We do not know what account/service these accounts belong to or how the criminals obtained them. It could be that these credentials were obtained in a phishing attack, or stolen from the usersâ€™ system with malware, but it can also be that these criminals bought a database with credentials from a malicious, third party.

Be aware that we have also emailed these individual users, but that these emails may have been intercepted by the criminals.

## What should we do?

* Determine the severity of this situation based on the number or credentials we emailed you about
* Investigate the accounts of these users for suspicious activities like large volumes of sent messages or unusual log in times or unusual mail rules
* Consider scanning the devices of these users with malware detection tools.
* Dual factor authentication can stop an attacker that has a valid username and password combination from abusing the account [implement two-step verification](https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication) in as many places as possible.
* Consider reporting this event to the appropriate authorities, e.g. law enforcement, privacy and other regulators.
