## Credentials of your users were found in a botnet in Operation Endgame

You have looked at our dataset for Operations Endgame S03E01 and discovered that domains of  your organisation are part of one or more of the datasets, now what?

If your domains are in a file with `domain_apexes` in the name, users of your service are part of the data seized as part of Operation Endgame S03E01.

If you have not already done so, send an email to [divd-2025-00041@csirt.divd.nl](mailto:divd-2025-00041@csirt.divd.nl?SUBJECT:Information+request+DIVD-2025-00041) to request additional data and analyse i

<!-- If you received a notification from us with the subject `Stolen service credentials found for your service in Police operation  - DIVD-2025-00041` it means that one or more credentials for users of your service have been found in a Botnet by the Dutch police. -->

## What does this mean?

What we know for sure is that combinations of email addresses and passwords that are associated with a service delivered by your organisation were compromised by criminals operating a botnet. They may have used these credentials to access your services, or to resell these accounts to others.
These credentials where likely obtained by means of information stealing malware. 

## What should you do?

Given that these credentials have been found by law enforcement, in a recent police operation:

* Determine the severity of this situation based on the number of credentials we emailed you about.
* Investigate the accounts of these users for suspicious activities like e.g. large volumes of sent messages,  unusual log in times, or unusual expenditure or other activities.
* Consider to notify your users that their accounts have been compromised, and if blocking their account is prudent.
* Dual factor authentication can stop an attacker that uses a compromised username and password combination from abusing the account [implement two-step verification](https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication) in as many places as possible.
* Consider reporting this event to the appropriate authorities, e.g. law enforcement, privacy and other regulators.
