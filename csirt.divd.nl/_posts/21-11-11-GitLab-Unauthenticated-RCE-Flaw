Today we opened case {% divd DIVD-2021-00030 %} to address a vulnerability known as CVE-2021-22205 in GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) affecting all versions starting from 11.9.
GitLab was not properly validating image files that is passed to a file parser, this resulted in a remote command execution (RCE).

In the coming days, we will be validating a obtained list of vulnerable servers. After validation, we will send notifications to our information sharing partners and individual network administrators.
