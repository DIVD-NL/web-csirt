## Summary
One of our researchers found multiple vulnerabilities in SmarterMail, which we were in the process of responsible disclosure (or Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure) with SmarterTools Inc. Both vulnerabilities were discovered within the webmail fronted of SmarterMail. 

## The vulnerabilities
We notified SmarterTools Inc. of the following vulnerabilities:
* [CVE-2021-32233](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-32233) - SmarterTools SmarterMail before Build 7776 allows XSS.
* [CVE-2021-32234](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-32234) - SmarterTools SmarterMail before Build 7776 allows Remote Code Execution.

## What you can do
If you run a version of SmarterMail before Build 7776, upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible. To verify if your SmarterMail installation is vulnerable, go within the SmarterMail portal to /about/checkup and verify the version number. If the version number is 100.0.7793 (May 3, 2021) or less and you are running SmarterMail version 16.x, then your vulnerable for these vulnerabilities.

## What we are doing
We are processing the list of vulnerable SmarterMail servers.
