## Summary
One of our researchers found multiple vulnerabilities in SmarterMail, which we were in the process of responsible disclosure (or Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure) with SmarterTools Inc. Both vulnerabilities were discovered within the webmail fronted of SmarterMail. 

## The vulnerabilities
We notified SmarterTools Inc. of the following vulnerabilities:
* [CVE-2021-32233](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-32233) - SmarterTools SmarterMail before Build 7776 allows XSS.
* [CVE-2021-32234](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-32234) - SmarterTools SmarterMail before Build 7776 allows Remote Code Execution.

## What you can do
If you run a version of SmarterMail before 100.0.7803 (May 13, 2021), upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible. To verify the installed version, go within the SmarterMail portal to /about/checkup (http[s]://yourwebmailurl.ext/about/checkup) and verify the version number. If the version number is 16.x or before 100.0.7803 (May 13, 2021) then you are vulnerable.

## What we are doing
We are processing the list of vulnerable SmarterMail servers.
