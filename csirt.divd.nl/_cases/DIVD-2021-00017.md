## Summary
DIVD researchers have identified two vulnerabilities in SolarWinds N-able N-central.

N-able N-central software prior to 2021.HF6 is vulnerable to:
* Agent takeover in a multi-tenant environment (NCCF-16663)
* Downloading and installing agents in a multi-tenant environment (NCCF-16662)

The NCCF numbers are bug identifiers assigned by SolarWinds. See the [release notes]( https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/Rel_2021-1-6_HF6/N-central_2021-1-6_HF6_ReleaseNotes_en.pdf) further information.

## Technical details
Authenticated users in a multi-tenant environment can abuse these vulnerabilities.

### Agent takeover
Agents, not available to the current user, can be hijacked. Resulting in a malicious actor gaining access to the agent host with SYSTEM level access. No interaction from other tenants is needed, this vulnerability can be exploited by abusing a series of API requests.

### Downloading and installing agents from a different tenant
An authenticated user can download agents from different tenants. This causes an information leak regarding the other tenant. The agent management could be disrupted by registering a high number of agents.

## What you can do
Update N-able N-central to 2021.HF6 or higher. Check for abuse indicators, if using a multi-tenant environment where the customer is able to login.
 
## What we are doing
The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) finds zero-days and reports these directly to the affected vendors.
