In addition, abuse of this vulnerability has been reported. Organisations are urged to install the updates made available by F5 or to apply mitigating measures.

## Impact

By leveraging the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the BIG-IP system through the management port and/or self IP addresses to execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, or disable services. 

## What you can do

* We recommend you to remediate the vulnerability by following [F5's advisory](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K23605346)

Fixes are available in versions 17.0.0, 16.1.2.2, 15.1.5.1, 14.1.4.6, and 13.1.5. Firmware versions 11.x and 12.x will not receive any security updates. You can:
-    Block iControl REST access through the self IP address
-    Block iControl REST access through the management interface, and
-    Modify the BIG-IP httpd configuration

or
- Take the instance offline

* Inspect your instance for backdoors, miners if possible.

## What we are doing
