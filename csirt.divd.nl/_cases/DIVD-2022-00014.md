## Summary

[GreyNoise](https://greynoise.io/) has published a "free, public, unauthenticated, self-updating feed of all IPs that are exclusively targeting devices geographically located in Ukraine's IP space with scans, exploits, etc." We first became aware of it via a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Andrew___Morris/status/1496923547872206852?s=20&t=Y5vBKAso8TRrwief4KpbLg) from GreyNoise founder Andrew Morris. We feel that in these times, network administrators should be aware of these IP addresses even if they are unaware of the services of GreyNoise.

We are using the list of "unspoofed" IPs (IP addresses that have completed a full three-way handshake) located on [GreyNoise Pulse](https://www.greynoise.io/viz/pulse). If you want to check other lists, feel free to inspect the [manifest](https://api.greynoise.io/datashots/ukraine/manifest.json) of the full API.

## What you can do

We are sending out these emails for awareness only. We want you to be aware that you have one or more nodes in your network displaying this behavior. How you act on this information is entirely up to you. We cannot determine if this behavior is expected, unexpected, logical, illogical, wanted, or unwanted by you.

## What we are doing

On a regular basis, we will retrieve the list from GreyNoise and send notifications to network administrators. We will only send out notifications for systems last seen on or after 1 March 2022 and only to system owners; we have not received a notification before.
