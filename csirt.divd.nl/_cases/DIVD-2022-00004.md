## Summary

During the Log4J crisis, there was an active campaign going on by [Team TNT](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0139/) to infect servers using the Log4Shell vulnerability ([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)) and install crypto miners. In this campaign, open database instances were used to control the infected servers, forming a botnet. The first attack was discovered on Sunday, December 13th, and multiple thousands of servers still seem to be used for this purpose, and with these thousands, a similar number of servers mining Monero for Team TNT.

## What you can do

* Ensure you are patched to the latest Log4J version and ensure any open database instances are properly secured. If you run **Log4J**, please check for any unknown SSH keys and users and the Monero miner software [XMrig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig). Common user names are **zoor** and **hilde**. If you run an **unprotected database instance**, check for any keys of which the value contains a URL ending with **.sh**. If you find this malware or are unsure, we recommend you reinstall your server to eliminate any possibilities or malware remaining on the server.

## What we are doing

* DIVD is currently ensuring that the owners of databases with sensitive data are being notified.
* DIVD is investigating if we can start informing individuals who were compromised.
