## Summary

We obtained a list of sites potentially vulnerable to SQL-Injection attacks in November of 2021. We started scanning the domains in the list we obtained for SQL-Injection vulnerabilities. The owners of the confirmed vulnerable sites will be notified by us via email.

## What we are doing

We started scanning the potentially vulnerable sites to see if they really were vulnerable to SQL-Injection attacks and will notify the owners of the sites confirmed vulnerable to this type of attacks.
