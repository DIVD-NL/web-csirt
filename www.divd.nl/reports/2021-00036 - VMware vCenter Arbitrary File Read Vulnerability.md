On November 23, 2021, VMware has released security updates for vCenter Server, addressing several vulnerabilities. VMware vCenter Server is a centralized management utility, used to manage multiple virtual machines from a single location (See also DIVD-2021-00010). Researchers found that VMware vCenter Server versions 6.5 or 6.7, and Cloud Foundation 3.x are vulnerable, because of an arbitrary file read, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) and a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Unauthenticated malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive information.<br>

December 3, 2021, DIVD started scanning for these versions and notified system administrators to upgrade VMware vCenter Server to the latest version as soon as possible.
