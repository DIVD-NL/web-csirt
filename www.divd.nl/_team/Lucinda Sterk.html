She started her career in journalism in 2004 and switched to communications and PR in 2008. After almost a decade at the National Crisiscenter for Counter Terrorism and cyber security she moved to Fox-IT. She loves working with nerds and nerds love working with her. Some call her the meme-queen. But everyone else can call her Boss of Communications.
