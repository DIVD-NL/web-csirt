External researcher Wilco van Beijnum together with DIVD researcher Harm van den Brink have foudn a total of 18 vulnerabilties applicable to at least two ioCharger EV chanrges, the ioCharger Home and the ioCharger Pedestal. Since both models operate on the same firmware it is likely that these vulnerabilities also apply to other ioCharger products that share the same firmware.

This discovery fits into DIVD's ongoing research into vulnerabilities that effect the smart grid, which is becoming more and more distributed in nature. In households that have electric vehicles (EVs), these vehicles are most of the time the biggest consumers of electricity in the house. THe ability to controle large numbers of EV charges may ultimatly lead to a situation where, by stopping and starting EV chargers in large numbers, a malicious actor may be able to effect the stability of the electricity grid.

When Wilco and Harm reported their findings to the DIVD CSIRT we immediately reached out to the vendor who promptly acknoledge the findings and created a new firmware version that addresses these vulnerabilities.
