excerpt: "The DIVD CSIRT is performing victim notification for Operation Endgame"
---
As part of our core task “Analyzing databases with leaked credentials and reporting to the organisations or people who are compromised to take appropriate measures.”, we are collaborating with the Dutch National Police on notifying victims of data that is obtained in Operation Endgame.

Operation Endgame is the largest (international) police operation against botnet operators to date. It involves amongst others the `Smokeloader`, `IcedId`, `Pikabot`, `SystemBC` and `Bumblebee` botnets. During this operation, victim data for millions of individuals across tens of thousands of organizations have been obtained.

We are running a large effort to send a notification email to each of the victims and all of the organizations alongside actions to take for remediation.

More information can be found in the [case file for DIVD-2024-00019](/DIVD-2024-00019).

We would like to congratulate the Dutch Police and their counterparts in Germany, France, Denmark, the United States and the United Kingdom as well as Europol and Eurojust on a successful operation.
