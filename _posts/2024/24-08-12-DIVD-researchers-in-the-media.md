On Monday the 12 Aug 2024, the Top Sector Energie has [published a report](https://topsectorenergie.nl/nl/kennisbank/maatregelen-cyberveiligheid-zonpv/) about an investigation into the vulnerability of the Dutch Solar Power systems, performed by [Secura](https://www.secura.com/) at the request of [Netherlands Enterprise Agency](https://english.rvo.nl/) and Top Sector Energie.

The report concludes that the solar power sector in The Netherlands has a “significant attack surface that is most likely to grow in the future”. According to the report, the consequences of a cyber attack in the Dutch solar power sector are potentially disastrous and can result in possibly devastating effects, causing major economic, physical, and social disruptions. 

The report also states that if we proceed with the current energy transition, we are moving away from Russian gas towards using ‘Chinese power’. The report of the Dutch Enterprise Agency has garnered significant attention in the Dutch media. 

The Dutch online platform for independent investigative journalism “[Follow The Money](https://www.ftm.nl/)” has recently [published a article](https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/hacker-kan-stekker-uit-zonnepanelen-trekken-en-stroomnet-platleggen) about the investigation into vulnerabilities in Dutch Solar Power systems. The investigation was performed by Wietse Boonstra and Hidde Smit, both researchers of DIVD, in case [DIVD-2024-00011](/DIVD-2024-00011/).

On Tuesday, August 13, 2024, at 18:35 CEST, the Dutch Current Affairs TV show [EenVandaag](https://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/) broadcasts an [episode](https://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/item/eenvandaag-13-08-2024/) discussing the topic. In this episode, the researchers of DIVD demonstrated how they were able exploit the vulnerability and take control of a solar panel.
