We just opened case {% divd DIVD-2021-00022 %} to address a set of vulnerabilities that enable the ProxyShell and ProxyOracle attacks.

We also released a [NSE scanning script](https://github.com/DIVD-NL/ProxyOracleNSE) so you can test your own server for ProxyOracle.

In the coming days we will be scanning worldwide to identify unpatched and thus vulnerable exchange servers and send notifications to our information sharing partners and individual network administrators.
