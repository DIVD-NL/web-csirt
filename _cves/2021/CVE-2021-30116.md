The default URL for this page is https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp\n\nWhen an attacker download a client for Windows and installs it, the file KaseyaD.ini is generated (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Kaseya\\XXXXXXXXXX\\KaseyaD.ini) which contains an Agent_Guid and AgentPassword\n\nThis Agent_Guid and AgentPassword can be used to log in on dl.asp (https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp?un=840997037507813&pw=113cc622839a4077a84837485ced6b93e440bf66d44057713cb2f95e503a06d9)\n\nThis request authenticates the client and returns a sessionId cookie that can be used in subsequent attacks to bypass authentication.\n\nSecurity issues discovered\n---\n* Unauthenticated download page leaks credentials\n* Credentials of agent software can be used to obtain a sessionId (cookie) that can be used for services not intended for use by agents\n* dl.asp accepts credentials via a GET request\n* Access to KaseyaD.ini gives an attacker access to sufficient information to penetrate the Kaseya installation and its clients.\n\nImpact\n---\nVia the page /dl.asp enough information can be obtained to give an attacker a sessionId that can be used to execute further (semi-authenticated) attacks against the system. \n"
