Adding CVEs to the site
=======================

CVE records are published from `_data/cves` where you can store the CVE records as `.json` files.

If you want to add text the the CVE page, you can add it as a MarkDown file in this collection (`_cves`).

The following CVE record versions are supported:
* 5.0
* 5.1
