## Summary

A vulnerability has been identified in CrushFTP, enabling unauthenticated malicious actors to bypass CrushFTP's Virtual File System, granting them access to sensitive system files.

Although using a DMZ for CrushFTP provides partial protection, unauthenticated malicious actors can still access sensitive CrushFTP configuration files.

This vulnerability is present in the CrushFTP web interface. Therefore, if only the SFTP port is exposed to the internet, you are protected from this vulnerability. However, updating to the latest version is still recommended as a precautionary measure.

## Recommendations

CrushFTP recommends upgrading to the latest available version. For users running versions in the v10 range, it's advised to update to V10.7.1. Alternatively, upgrading to v11.1.0 is also an option.

For those operating CrushFTP servers within the v11 range, updating to v11.1.0 is recommended.

If your CrushFTP version falls within the v9 range, it's strongly recommended to upgrade immediately to v11.1.0. Enterprise customers of CrushFTP can reach out to CrushFTP for assistance with obtaining a license code.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently identifying vulnerable instances and notifying the owners of these systems.
