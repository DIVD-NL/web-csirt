## Summary

The vCenter Server contains multiple heap-overflow vulnerabilities in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may trigger these vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted network packet potentially leading to remote code execution.

## Recommendations

To remediate CVE-2024-37079, and CVE-2024-37080 apply the updates listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below to affected deployments. You can find the 'Response Matrix' at the bottom of this post.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of vCenter Server and to notify these parties. We do this by looking at the version numbers if possible.
