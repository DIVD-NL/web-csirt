## Summary

SolarWinds U-Serv was vulnerable to a Local File Inclusion vulnerability caused by a Path Traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to read sensitive information from the host server. Leaking this information could lead to an attacker compromising the server.

## Recommendations

SolarWinds released a hotfix for version 15.4.2. Install this hotfix as soon as possible, the corresponding version number is 15.4.2 HF2 (15.4.2.157).

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of SolarWinds U-Serv and to notify these parties. We do this by looking at the version numbers if possible and otherwise verifying the presence of the vulnerability in a harmless manner.
