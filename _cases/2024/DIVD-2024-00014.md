## Summary

A set of remote code execution vulnerabilities was reported for Qlik Sense in 2023. DIVD is rescanning previously known vulnerable instances in an effort to increase patch rates. Not patching the device might result in a compromised Qlik Sense, which in turn could result in attacks such as leaked data or ransomware as described in a [blog by Arctic Wolf](https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/qlik-sense-exploited-in-cactus-ransomware-campaign/) and a [press release by project Melissa](https://cyberveilignederland.nl/actueel/persbericht-samenwerkingsverband-melissa-vindt-diverse-nederlandse-slachtoffers-van-ransomwaregroepering-cactus).

DIVD is running this case in collaboration with [Project Melissa](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/nieuws/2023/oktober/3/melissa-samenwerkingsverband-ransomwarebestrijding) in which various Dutch cyber security companies collaborate to make The Netherlands less attractive for ransomware gangs. From combined research between [Fox-IT](https://blog.fox-it.com/2024/04/25/sifting-through-the-spines-identifying-potential-cactus-ransomware-victims/), [Northwave](https://northwave-cybersecurity.com/whitepapers-articles/pricksense-how-cactus-exploits-qlik-sense), [Responders BV](https://www.responders.nu/) and [ESET Netherlands](https://www.eset.com/nl/) it has been identified that vulnerable Qlik Sense instances are used to compromise corporate environments and install ransomware.

Fox-IT scanned for vulnerable instances and together with the [Dutch NCSC](https://ncsc.nl), and [DTC](https://www.digitaltrustcenter.nl/) we sent out notifications to these (potential) victims either directly or via country certs.

## Recommendations

Qlik recommends to upgrade to at least a version where the issue is fixed:
* August 2023 Patch 2 
* May 2023 Patch 6 
* February 2023 Patch 10 
* November 2022 Patch 12 
* August 2022 Patch 14 
* May 2022 Patch 16 
* February 2022 Patch 15 
* November 2021 Patch 17 


## What we are doing

DIVD is currently identifying vulnerable instances and notifying the owners of these systems.
