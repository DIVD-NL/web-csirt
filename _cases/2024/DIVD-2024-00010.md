## Summary

A critical security issue was recently identified in Kemp LoadMaster. It is possible for unauthenticated, remote attackers who have access to the management interface of LoadMaster to issue a carefully crafted API command that will allow arbitrary system commands to be executed without authentication.

## Recommendations

Progress advises users to install the security patch as soon as possible. See the references for the download links. 

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify vulnerable instances and notify the owners of these systems.
