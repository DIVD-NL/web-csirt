## Summary
GeoServer and GeoTools have issued a security announcement and fixed an XPath expression injection vulnerability. This vulnerability results in unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to gain full access to the system without authentication.

## Recommendations
GeoServer released several patched versions (2.24.4, 2.25.2 and 2.23.6). Please update to one of those versions (or better) as soon as possible.

GeoTools released several patched versions (29.6, 30.4 and 31.2). Please update to one of those versions (or better) as soon as possible.

## Mitigation
If relevant users cannot install updates temporarily, the following measures can be taken for temporary relief: Deleting the `gt-complex-x.y.jar` file in GeoServer (x.y is the version of GeoTools, such as `gt-complex-31.1.jar` in GeoServer 2.25.1) will remove vulnerable code from GeoServer, but may compromise some GeoServer functionality. When a gt-complex module is required by an extension in use, it may cause the GeoServer deployment to fail.

## What we are doing
DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of Geoserver and to notify these parties. We do this by verifying the presence of the vulnerability in a harmless manner and collect the software version number if possible.
