## Summary
GeoServer and GeoTools have issued a security announcement and fixed an XPath expression injection vulnerability. This vulnerability results in unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to gain full access to the system without authentication.

## Recommendations
Geoserver released serveral patched versions (2.24.4, 2.25.2, 2.23.6) Please update to one of those versions (or better) as soon as possible.

## What we are doing
DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of Geoserver and to notify these parties. We do this by verifying the presence of the vulnerability in a harmless manner and collect the software version number if possible.
