## Summary

The Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) version 2.3x up to, and including version 2.4 RC07, suffer from a server-side template injection (SSTI) vulnerability that does not require authentication. This vulnerability affects both the Windows and Wine versions. This flaw allows a remote attacker, without needing to authenticate, to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the HFS.exe server process. 
This vulnerability is present in version 2.3x up to, and including version 2.4 RC07. As version 2.x of HFS is no longer supported, users are advised to migrate to the supported version 3.x to ensure security.

## Recommendations

The Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) version 2.3x is no longer supported by the maintainers and no patch is available. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.x.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a version of Rejetto HTTP File Servers (HFS) that contain this vulnerability and notify these parties. We do this by finding vulnerable Rejetto HFS that are connected to the Internet and verifying the version installed.
