## Summary
CyberAudit-Web is a software suite for the CyberLock system, an electronic lock. Researchers of DIVD have found two vulnerabilities in the CyberAudit-Web suite, potentially allowing malicious actors to compromise CyberAudit-Web installations and the locks associated with it.

The two vulnerabilities include a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability in older versions of the videx-legacy-ssl library and an Authentication Bypass in CyberAudit-Web versions before 9.8.11, which are End-of-Life. Acknowledging the severity, CyberLock has made a patch available for both customers with and without support contract.

## Recommendations
Install the CyberLock-provided security patch on your system as soon as possible.

## What we are doing
DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of CyberAudit-Web and to notify these parties. We do this by verifying the presence of the vulnerability in a harmless manner and collect the software version number if possible.
