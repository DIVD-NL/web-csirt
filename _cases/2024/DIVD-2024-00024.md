title: "Multiple vulnerabilities found in the SOPlanning tool"
author: Victor Pasman
lead: Max van der Horst
excerpt: "In the SOPlanning Online Planning tool, multiple critical vulnerabilities were found, including an unauthenticated SQL injection. When the non-default public view setting is enabled, it results in several Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code on the underlying system and access the database."

## Summary

The SOPlanning Online Planning tool up to version 1.52.02 contains several vulnerabilities which can be summarized to:
- An unauthenticated SQL injection, an attacker can misuse this vulnerability to retrieve information from the database.
- Two unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, these make it possible for an attacker to upload and execute an executables on the system.
- Insecure Direct Object Reference, which makes in possible for an attacker to export Database

All of these vulnerabilities would allow an attacker to take control of the underlying system.

## Recommendations

Update to the latest version of SOPlanning tool. If this is not possible, upgrade to version 1.52.02.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a version of the SO Planning tool that contain these vulnerabilities and notify these parties. We do this by finding vulnerable SOPlanning Tool systems that are connected to the Internet and verifying the version installed.
