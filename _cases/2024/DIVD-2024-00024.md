## Summary

Various vulnerabilities in the SOPlanning Online Planning Tool have been found by DIVD researchers. The vulnerabilities are present in version 1.52.01. The first vulnerability allows for unauthenticated SQL Injection, which allows an attacker to take control over the underlying database. The second and third vulnerabilities are Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities, which allow attackers to execute code on the underlying system. The fourth and last vulnerability allows attackers to export the database through an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability. 

All vulnerabilites are critical and require immediate patching to prevent compromise. 

## Recommendations

Update your SOPlanning instance to version 1.52.02 at your earliest convenience.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a version of SOPlanning Online Planning Tool that contains these vulnerabilities and notify these parties. We do this by finding instances that are connected to the Internet and verifying the version installed.
