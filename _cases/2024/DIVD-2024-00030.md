## Summary
Serveral vulnerabilities have been found in Zyxel NAS devices NAS326 & NAS542. When exploited it's possible for attackers with network/internet access to get full access on the NAS device as a root user. As outlined in the Outpost24 blog (linke below) several CVE's combined are needed to reach this state, like Python Code Injection, Local Privilege Escalation and Persistent Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities as reported in the assigned CVE's. During our scan we focus on CVE-2024-29973 to identify vulnerable devices with older firmware versions that include those vulnerabilities.

## Recommendations

Zyxel advises upgrading to the latest firmware version to benefit from the vulnerability fixes. On the versions below, the mentioned vulnerabilities have been fixed:

- NAS326 -> [V5.21(AAZF.17)C0](https://download.zyxel.com/NAS326/firmware/NAS326_V5.21(AAZF.17)C0.zip) (released May 10th 2024) 
- NAS542 -> [V5.21(ABAG.14)C0](https://download.zyxel.com/NAS542/firmware/NAS542_V5.21(ABAG.14)C0.zip) (released May 10th 2024) 

DIVD recommends that you do not have this device reachable from the internet unless it is absolutely nessecary. If this is the case, a firewall rule should be placed in front of the Zyxel NAS device so that it can only be accessed from trusted IP addresses so attackers will have no access.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify vulnerable parties and notifying them. We do this by finding Zyxel NAS devices connected to the internet and verifying if the device is running the latest firmware version to be protected against the above described threats. The notifications will be sent to the party responsible for the ip address according to the whois database.
