## Summary
Zimbra, a widely used email and collaboration platform, recently released a critical security update addressing a severe vulnerability in its postjournal service. The postjournal service in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) before 8.8.15 Patch 46, 9 before 9.0.0 Patch 41, 10 before 10.0.9, and 10.1 before 10.1.1 sometimes allows unauthenticated users to execute commands.

## Recommendations

To remediate CVE-2024-45519 apply the updates listed at the Zimbra Security Center. You can find a link to the Zimbra Security Center at the bottom of this post.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) and to notify these parties. We do this by looking at the version numbers if possible. Although our fingerprinting cannot confirm if instances are vulnerable under the specific conditions, we want to issue a warning that parties should upgrade or patch if their instance falls within the specified vulnerable versions.
