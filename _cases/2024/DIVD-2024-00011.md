## Summary

DIVD researchers Wietse Boonstra and Hidde Smit have discovered six critical vulnerabilities in Enphase IQ Gateway devices (formerly known as Enphase Envoy). The vulnerabilities are presentin in version 4.x to 8.x. Version 8.2.4225 and later are patched. The first three can be combined into a Remote Command Execution attack. For older (v7.x and older) devices, the password may be a weak default or calculatable based on the serial number which can be remotely read (See [CVE-2020-25754](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25754)). With these vulnerabilities, attackers could take control over the Enphase IQ Gateway device.

## What you can do

We recommend that you do not expose your Enphase IQ Gateway device to an untrusted network. As long as these bulnerabilities are unpatched you device can be taken over remotely. We recommend that you do not (re)expose you device after it has een patched by Enphase, to protect against future vulnerabilities.

You cannot upgrade the firmware of the Envoy IQ Gateway yourself. This is managed by Enphase. Enphase has released patches for five of these vulnerabilities which has made exploitation of the remaining cve ({% cve CVE-2024-21878 %}) impossible using any of the other CVEs.

## What we are doing

DIVD has responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Enphase, which has remediated the vulnerabilities. Now, DIVD is collaborating with Enphase to find vulnerable and exposed Envoy IQ Gateways worldwide in order to assist with the patching process.
