## Summary

Six critical vulnerabilities have been discovered in Enphase inverters of versions R7 and R8 that can be combined into Remote Command Execution. For older Enphase inverters, the password may be a weak default or calculatable based on the serial number which can be remotely read (See {% cve CVE-2020-25754 %}). With these vulnerabilities, attackers could take control over the solar inverter.

## What you can do

We recommend that, as long as these vulnerabilities remain unpatched, you do not expose your Enphase inverter to an untrusted network.

## What we are doing

DIVD has responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Enphase, which has remediated the vulnerabilities. Now, DIVD is collaborating with Enphase to find vulnerable and exposed Envoy devices worldwide in order to assist with the patching process.
