## Summary
This initiative focuses on identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in the publicly accessible assets of NGOs. This is a collaboration with [CyberPeace Institute](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/), [The Hague Humanity Hub (HHH)](https://www.humanityhub.net/) and [CSIRT.global](https://csirt.global)

## Recommendations
After receiving a notification, it is very important that the vulnerability outlined in the correspondence is promptly addressed and remediated. The notification will provide detailed information, including the specific location and a comprehensive description of the identified vulnerability.

Please do not hesitate to reply to this email if you have any questions or need help with the mitigation process. Our team can readily offer support and guidance to ensure the vulnerability is effectively resolved.
 
## What we are doing
The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) has been proactively identifying and assessing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for potential security vulnerabilities. Our team conducts thorough scans to detect any known weaknesses within these entities. Upon identifying vulnerabilities, we promptly notify and inform the affected organizations.

These notifications are dispatched in multiple phases. The initial phase addresses general vulnerabilities uncovered during our preliminary scanning operations. Subsequently, a more detailed, manual inspection is conducted to identify deeper, more complex issues. The findings from this rigorous analysis are communicated in a second wave of notifications. This methodical approach ensures that NGOs are well-informed and equipped to enhance their cybersecurity posture.

## What is next
After the collaboration part is over, DIVD is going to continue supporting NGO's as best as we can under a new, larger project also named Global NGO's. This page is just kept online for legacy reasons.
