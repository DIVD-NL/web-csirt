## Summary

As part of [Operation Endgame](https://www.politie.nl/xxx) the Dutch Police and [Europol](https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-events/main-reports/xxx) have infiltrated a number of botnets. During this infiltration they obtained data about the victims of these botnets. 

This data has been shared with us and various other parties like [Have I Been Pwned] (https://haveibeenpwned.com/) ,[Spam House] (https://spamhouse.org), [Project No More Leaks] (https://www.politie.nl/onderwerpen/no-more-leaks.html), the (Dutch) [ NCSC] (https://nsc.nl),  [CSIRT-DSP](https://csirtdsp.nl/), and [Digital Trust Center] (https://www.digitaltrustcenter.nl/).

The data we have received consists of the following data sets:
1. Email credentials, either SMTP or IMAP credentials
2. ADFS credentials consisting of AD-domain and login credentials
3. Unlabelled individual (email) account credentials.

## What you can do

Upon receiving a notification about compromised credentials, make sure to change the mentioned password for all accounts it is used on. Moreover, because the credentials were obtained with Information Stealer malware, make sure to review your system for any malicious software.

Give as much direct actions as you can either in a story obut:
* Bullits
* Are
* Ok

## What we are doing

DIVD has analyzed the dataset and is currently notifying victims of any compromised accounts. Email addresses that were found in the dataset receive an email with the found email address, a masked password only showing the last four characters, and a set of recommendations to prevent subsequent compromise.

What are our actions, what are we doing. could be a story, but:
* Bullits
* Are
* Ok
