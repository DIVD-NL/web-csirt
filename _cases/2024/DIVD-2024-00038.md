title: "Remote Code Execution CUPS"
author: Dennis Kussendrager
lead: Dennis Kussendrager
excerpt: "A remote attacker can replace or install printers with malicious IPP URLs, leading to arbitrary command execution when a print job is started."
researchers:
- Olivier Beg
- Dennis Kussendrager
- Stan Plasmeijer
cves:
- CVE-2024-47076
- CVE-2024-47175
- CVE-2024-47176
- CVE-2024-47177 
product:
- CUPS
versions: 
- cups-browsed ≤ 2.0.1
- libcupsfilters ≤ 2.1b1
- libppd ≤ 2.1b1
- cups-filters ≤ 2.0.
recommendation: "Update to a non-vulnerable version"
workaround: "Disable and remove the cups-browsed service if not needed. Block traffic to UDP port 631 and DNS-SD traffic if not necessary."

## Summary
According to public research, four vulnerabilities ({% cve CVE-2024-47176 %}, {% cve CVE-2024-47076 %}, {% cve CVE-2024-47175 %}, and {% cve CVE-2024-47177 %}) affect various components of the open-source CUPS printing service common to Linux and UNIX systems. When attackers chain these vulnerabilities together, they can remotely run commands on a target web-facing device or on a device on a local network they can already access.

## Recommendations
Mitigating risks associated with vulnerabilities requires a combination of proactive measures and real-time defenses. Here are some recommendations:  

- Update the CUPS package. 
- Disable and remove the cups-browsed service if not needed. 
- Block traffic to UDP port 631 and DNS-SD traffic if not necessary. 

## What we are doing
DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of CUPS and to notify these parties. We do this by looking at the version numbers if possible.
