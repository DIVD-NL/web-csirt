## Summary
​
An authentication bypass and command injection vulnerability were discovered in Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure. Multiple sources report active exploitation by threat actors, making immediate mitigation necessary. By combining these two vulnerabilities, threat actors are able to take complete control of the underlying system. Ivanti does not yet have a patch, which is expected to be released in the week of January 22nd. In the meantime, a mitigation is provided that can be downloaded in the Ivanti download portal. 
​
## What you can do
The patch is expected to be released in the week of January 22nd. Before the release, it is crucial the provided mitigation is applied as soon as possible. The mitigation can be applied by downloading and importing mitigation.release.20240107.1.xml from the Ivanti download portal. Additionally, Volexity (see references) provided detection rules to monitor for exploitation.

## What we are doing
​DIVD is currently working to identify vulnerable instances and notify the owners of these systems. We do this by scanning for exposed Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure instances, and checking the version number to determine whether the vulnerability is present. Owners of vulnerable instances receive a notification with the host information and mitigation steps.
