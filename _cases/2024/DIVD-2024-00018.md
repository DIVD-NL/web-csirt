author: Stan Plasmeijer
lead: Stan Plasmeijer
excerpt: "In Citrix Netscaler and Gateway products (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy), an Out-Of-Bounds Memory Read vulnerability has been found by BishopFox. This vulnerability lets unauthenticated attackers obtain information from memory. However, it does not allow attackers to retrieve controlled information from memory."

## Summary

In Citrix Netscaler and Gateway products (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy), an Out-Of-Bounds Memory Read vulnerability has been found by BishopFox. This vulnerability allows malicious actors to read information from memory, although they cannot do so in a controlled manner. BishopFox has found instances where the disclosed memory contained data from HTTP requests, sometimes including POST request bodies.

BishopFox discovered the vulnerability on January 22 and publicy disclosed it on May 6, 2024. Citrix has updated CVE-2023-6549 to include this out-of-bounds memory read vulnerability.

## Recommendations

If a vulnerable Citrix version is used, it is recommended to update it to the latest possible version.

Should an end-of-life version be used, we recommend upgrading the Citrix instance.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of Citrix that contains this vulnerability and notify these parties. We do this by checking whether the Citrix instance has been patched for the vulnerability, for this we are using a minimized Proof-of-Concept (PoC). The minimized PoC, doesn't return any information.
