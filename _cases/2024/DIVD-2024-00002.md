## Summary
 
An account takeover vulnerability via password reset without any user interactions was discovered in Gitlab CE/EE. This vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-7028 and can allow an attacker to take control over administrator accounts. Gitlab has released a patch to remediate the vulnerability. This vulnerability is currently exploited in the wild.

 
## What you can do
Given that there is active exploitation, it is crucial to patch the system as soon as possible. Gitlab recommends patching the system and enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all GitLab accounts.

## What we are doing
DIVD is currently working to identify vulnerable instances and notify the owners of these systems. We do this by scanning for exposed Gitlab instances, and checking the version number to determine whether the vulnerability is present. Owners of vulnerable instances receive a notification with the host information and mitigation steps.
