## Summary

Security researcher Wilco van Beijnum assisted by DIVD researcher Harm van den Brink has found 26 severe vulnerabilities in two ioCharge products. 

He found 17 vulnerabilities in the ioCharge Home ranging from CVSS9.9 to CVSS3.1. THese vulnerabilities are:
- {% cve CVE-2024-43648 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #1 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43649 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #2 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43650 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #3 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43651 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #4 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43652 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #5 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43653 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #6 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43654 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #7 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43655 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #8 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43656 %} - Authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability #1 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43657 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #9 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43658 %} - Authenticated arbitrary deletion of files vulnerability #1 - CVSS 9.6
- {% cve CVE-2024-43659 %} - Insufficiently protected plain text default credentials #1 - CVSS 8.2
- {% cve CVE-2024-43660 %} - Authenticated arbitrary file download vulnerability #1 - CVSS 7.7
- {% cve CVE-2024-43661 %} - Authenticated buffer overflow leading to DoS vulnerability #1 - CVSS 6.5
- {% cve CVE-2024-43662 %} - Authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability #2 - CVSS 4.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43663 %} - Various authenticated buffer overflow vulnerabilities - CVSS 4.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43664 %} - Exposure of login service via the chargning cable (HLC) - CVSS 3.1

Alltough all attacks are authenticated, an attacker that is in posession of a device or firmware image is able to extract all information needed to execute these attacks on other devices. Successfull exploitation give an attacker the ability to take full control over any device it can gain acces to, either remotely via the internet, by being on the same (visitor) network as the charger or via the charging cable.

He also found 9 vulnerabilities in the ioCharge Pedestal device, ranging from CVSS 9.9 to CVSS 4.3. THese vulnerabilities are:

- {% cve CVE-2024-43665 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #1 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43666 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #2 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43667 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #3 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43668 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #4 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43669 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #5 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43670 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #6 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43671 %} - Insufficiently protected plain text default credentials #1 - CVSS 8.2
- {% cve CVE-2024-43672 %} - Authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability #1 - CVSS 9.9
- {% cve CVE-2024-43673 %} - Various authenticated buffer overflow vulnerabilities - CVSS 4.3

Successfull exploitation give an attacker the ability to take full control over any device it can gain acces to, either remotely via the internet or by being on the same (visitor) network as the charger.

## What you can do

The vulnerabilities have been fix in either ioCharge Home firmware version (#TODO version number), or ioCharge Pendestal firmware version (#TODO: version number). The best cause of action is to update the firmware of your device. You can do so by (#TODO: update description)

Additionally we recommend that you do not expose your ioCharge device to an untrusted network. 

## What we are doing

DIVD has responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to ioCharge, whoi have released patches for these vulnerabilities. Now that these vulnerabilities have been published, we are scanning the internet to identify these devices and warn owners or network administrators that these devices are vulnerable and need to be updated.
