## Summary

Security researcher Wilco van Beijnum assisted by DIVD researcher Harm van den Brink has found 18 severe vulnerabilities in two IoCharger products. 

He found 18 vulnerabilities in the IoCharger Home ranging from CVSS9.9 to CVSS3.1. THese vulnerabilities are:
- {% cve CVE-2024-43648 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #1 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43649 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #2 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43650 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #3 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43651 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #4 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43652 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #5 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43653 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #6 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43654 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #7 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43655 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #8 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43656 %} - Authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability #1 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43657 %} - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability #9 - CVSSv4 9.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43658 %} - Authenticated arbitrary deletion of files vulnerability #1 - CVSSv4 7.2
- {% cve CVE-2024-43659 %} - Insufficiently protected plain text default credentials #1 - CVSSv4 8.4
- {% cve CVE-2024-43660 %} - Authenticated arbitrary file download vulnerability #1 - CVSSv4 7.1
- {% cve CVE-2024-43661 %} - Authenticated buffer overflow leading to DoS vulnerability #1 - CVSSv4 7.1
- {% cve CVE-2024-43662 %} - Authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability #2 - CVSSv4 5.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43663 %} - Various authenticated buffer overflow vulnerabilities - CVSSv4 5.3
- {% cve CVE-2024-43664 %} - Exposure of login service via the chargning cable (HLC) - CVSSv4 1.0

Alltough all attacks are authenticated, an attacker that is in posession of a device or firmware image is able to extract all information needed to execute these attacks on other devices. Successfull exploitation give an attacker the ability to take full control over any device it can gain acces to, either remotely via the internet, by being on the same (visitor) network as the charger or via the charging cable.

The vendor reports that firmware version 20241118-190348 fixes these vulnerabilities, we have not been able to verify this because we no longer have access to the hardware.

## What you can do

The vulnerabilities have been fix in firmware version 20241118-190348 which is applicable to both puducts (and potentially other IoCharger pruducts as well).  The best cause of action is to update the firmware of your device. We have not received clear information from the vendor as to whow you can update your device.

Additionally we recommend that you do not expose your IoCharger device to an untrusted network. 

## What we are doing

DIVD has responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to ioCharge, whoi have released patches for these vulnerabilities. Now that these vulnerabilities have been published, we are scanning the internet to identify these devices and warn owners or network administrators that these devices are vulnerable and need to be updated.
