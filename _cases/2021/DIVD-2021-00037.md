## Summary

DIVD researchers have identified multiple vulnerabilities in ITarian products. The vulnerabilities have been found in the following products:
* ITarian SaaS platform (version < 3.49.0)
* ITarian on-premise (version 6.35.37347.20040)
* Endpoint Manager Communication Client (version < 7.0.42012.22030)

ITarian on-premise platform is vulnerable to:
* {% cve CVE-2022-25151 %}, Session cookie not protected by HttpOnly flag (ITarian SaaS platform / on-premise)
* {% cve CVE-2022-25152 %}, Creation of procedure and bypass approvals by any user with a valid session token (ITarian SaaS platform / on-premise)

Endpoint Manager Communication Client was vulnerable to:
* {% cve CVE-2022-25153 %}, Endpoint Manager agent local privilege escalation

The Saas Platform had an additional vulnerability:
* A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the helpdesk function

On 18 Feb 2022, the vulnerability in the Endpoint Manager Communications Client was resolved. The other vulnerabilities were resolved on 19 May 2022.

The coordinated vulnerability process worked but suffered from a communications breakdown, which caused a serious delay in the issues being resolved. However, once there was a direct communications line between DIVD researchers and ITarian's software engineering, the issues were resolved quickly.


The consequences of these vulnerabilities could have been severe. By chaining the XSS in the helpdesk function with {% cve CVE-2022-25152 %} an attacker would theoretically be able to create a service desk ticket that, when viewed by a user with a valid session token, would execute a workflow on all clients with superuser privileges. It is a small consolidation that the service desk module is not turned on by default.

It is important to note that {% cve CVE-2022-25151 %} and {% cve CVE-2022-25152 %} are still present in the on-premise version of the ITarian platform. Even though ITarian still offers the software for download, this version of the software was discontinued over 2 years ago and ITarian has informed us that it will not be updated.

## What you can do

All users of ITarian products should be aware of the privilege escalation on Endpoint Manager Communications Client on Windows. This agent is installed by default on all Windows systems managed via either the Saas or on-premise version of ITarian and allowed an attacker with low privilege system access to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. We advise users to update this agent to at least version v7.0.42012.22030

The vulnerabilities we reported in the SaaS service, have all been resolved in version v3.49.0. This is an upgrade performed by ITarian, and no user action is required.

ITarian has informed us that support for their on-premise solution has seized over two years ago and that the vulnerabilities we found will therefore not be fixed in this version. Given the seriousness of the solution and the power of the platform, we would recommend those using the on-premise version to:
a. Investigate alternative solutions. Either the ITarian SaaS service or another on-premise product as this product is no longer supported
b. To fully disconnect the ITarian on-premise solution from the internet, and
c. To not rely upon the permissions and approvals model built into ITarian. 

## What we are doing

We have worked with ITarian to the best of our abilities to get these vulnerabilities fixed in a timely manner.

At this moment in time, we have identified that there are a, very limited number of, ITarian on-premise installations still internet accessible. We will try to contact the owners of these installations to warn them.
