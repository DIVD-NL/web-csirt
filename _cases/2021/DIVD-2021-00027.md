## Summary

Apache HTTP Server project version 2.4.49 has a vulnerability in their path normalization which allows an attacker to map URLs to files outside the document root by launching a path traversal and file disclosure. The vulnerability can also  be bypassed in apache 2.4.50. As there has been evidence of exploitation in the wild we advice to patch with high priority.


## What you can do

If you run Apache HTTP server version 2.4.49/2.4.50, downgrade to 2.4.48 or upgrade to 2.4.51.

## What we are doing

We are actively scanning for vulnerable machines on the internet.
