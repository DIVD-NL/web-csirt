## Summary

DIVD researcher Wietse Boonstra discovered a total of six vulnerabilities in OSNEXUS QuantaStor. These vulnerabilities included a Server-Side Request Forgery, Remote Command Execution, Privilege Escalation and two Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. Abuse of these vulnerabilities could lead to the compromise of your server.

## Impact

By leveraging these vulnerabilities, an attacker could execute code on the webpage, make requests on the server's behalf and gain root privilege on the server, potentially leading to total compromise of the environment.

## What you can do

- Make sure that your OSNexus Quanstor appliance is not publicly accessible
- Update to the latest version of QuantaStor as soon as possible. We have not been able to determine if the vulnerabilities have been addressed in the latest version of the product

## What we are doing
We have published this case file as a product warning given the lack of (visible) vendor cooperation.
Based on our [CNA guidelines](/cna) we have given OSNexus ample time to acknowledge our findings (388 days) and ample time to fix the vulnerabilities (at least 6 months). And it is now time for a limited disclosure.
