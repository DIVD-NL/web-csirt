## Summary

On 17 November 2021, the case was created, and around the end of 2021 the investigation began. This concerns Windows servers that are running the latest version of SmarterTrack, which was at the time v100.0.8019.14010. Wietse found four different vulnerabilities, which are currently all fixed in the latest version.

## What you can do

If you are using SmarterTrack, check your version number to see if you're still vulnerable. If you are using an older version, then update by downloading the newer build here. There is also an opportunity to see if the vulnerabilities have been exploited on your system before.

## What we are doing

We notified the SmarterTools, and they brought out a new, fully patched version.
