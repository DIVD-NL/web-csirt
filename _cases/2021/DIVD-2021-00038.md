## Summary

Apache reported a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Log4j2, the vulnerability in the Log framework of Apache makes it possible to misuse the record log information feature. This makes it possible for an attacker to construct special data request packets through this vulnerable component, and ultimately trigger remote code execution.

## What you can do

If you run Apache with version less then 2.0 or Apache and/or log4j2 less then 2.15.0-rc1 upgrade to version 2.17.1 as soon as possible.

## What we are doing

We are scanning the internet for vulnerable servers, and will notify system owners via the listed abuse contacts.
