## Summary
An authentication bypass vulnerability allowing remote code execution was discovered in the User Portal and Webadmin of Sophos Firewall and responsibly disclosed to Sophos. The fully working exploit method has not been released, due to the fact that it was directly reported to Sophos via their bug bounty program. However, there is extensive research happening in the world to exploit this vulnerability, the root cause is already known and that's how we validate whether Sophos Firewall instances patched or not. 

## Impact
By leveraging the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the Sophos Firewall can execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, disable services or gain access to the internal network.
