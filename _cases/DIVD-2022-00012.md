## Summary

Following the data leak of war victims at the Red Cross, DIVD started looking for vulnerabilities in charities worldwide. This effort is aimed at vulnerabilities regarding charities’ assets reachable via the public internet. 

## What you can do

* If you receive a notification, make sure the vulnerability described in that notification is patched. The notification will be sent along with a location and description of the vulnerability. If you have any questions regarding the mitigation of these vulnerabilities, feel free to reply to the email and we’ll gladly help. 

## What we are doing

* DIVD is currently searching for charities and scanning these charities for known vulnerabilities. Any charity that is found to be vulnerable receives an email with the information. These emails will be sent in two waves. The first wave regards general vulnerabilities found through scanning, whereas the second involves notifications of issues that were found upon manual, deeper inspection.
