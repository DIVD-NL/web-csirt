## Summary
Ivanti has resolved an authentication bypass (CVE-2025-4427) in EPMM, where only the on-premises instances are vulnerable. Abuse of the authentication bypass can be chained with a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-4428). Exploitation of these vulnerabilities has been observed in the wild. The following Ivanti EPMM versions are vulnerable: 11.12.0.4, 12.3.0.1, 12.4.0.1, 12.5.0.0 and prior versions.

Installing the following Ivanti EPMM versions will resolve the specified vulnerabilities: 11.12.0.5, 12.3.0.2, 12.4.0.2 or 12.5.0.1

## Recommendations
Installing the following Ivanti EPMM versions will resolve the specified vulnerabilities: 11.12.0.5, 12.3.0.2, 12.4.0.2 or 12.5.0.1. If the implementation of these specified versions is not feasible, then there is a workaround available. In this situation users can mitigate the threat by filtering access to the API using either the built in Portal ACLs functionality of Ivanti EPMM or an external WAF. More information on the implementation of the workaround can be found at the Ivanti [help portal](https://help.ivanti.com/mi/help/en_us/core/12.x/sys/CoreSystemManager/Access_Control_Lists__Po.htm)

## What we are doing
DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of Ivanti EPMM and to notify these parties.
