## Summary

The Pterodactyl Panel software contains a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. Successful exploitation can result in full system compromise, including access to credentials, sensitive data, and hosted servers.

The vulnerability is known to be actively exploited in the wild. Organisations running vulnerable versions are at immediate risk.

The issue has been resolved in version 1.11.11 of the Pterodactyl Panel. It is strongly recommended to update to the latest version as soon as possible.


## What you can do

It is strongly advised that all impacted organisations immediately update their Pterodactyl Panel installations to the latest available version (v1.11.11) as described in the following [Advisory](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-24wv-6c99-f843).

Installing version v1.11.11 fully resolves the critical vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-49132, which allows unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the Panel.

If updating to the latest version is not immediately feasible, a temporary workaround is possible. Organisations can mitigate the threat by implementing protective measures at the network or application layer, for more information see the [Advisory](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-24wv-6c99-f843).


## What we are doing

* We are scanning the internet for vulnerable Pterodactyl servers, and will notify system owners via the listed abuse contacts.
