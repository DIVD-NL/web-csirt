## Summary
Within the Ingress-Nginx there is a Remote Code Execution found. This can result in a complete cluster takeover. This vulnerability has been resolved in the upgraded version of the controller. 
The patched versions are 1.12.1 or 1.11.5

## Recommendations
Upgrading the Ingress-Nginx Controller to the following version will resolved the vulnerability: 1.12.1 or 1.11.5.
If the implementation of these specified versions is not feasible you can reduse the risk by turning off the Validating Admission Controller feature.
More information on the implementation of the workaround can be found at the [Kubernetes Blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/24/ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974/)

## What we are doing
DIVD is currently working to identify parties that are running a vulnerable version of Ivanti EPMM and to notify these parties.
