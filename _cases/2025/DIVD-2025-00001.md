## Summary

Late 2021, during an investigation into hacked sites used in a spam network, DIVD researcher Jesse Meijer stumbles upon, unrelated, source code of Sicomm BASEC, and decides to report this source code being publicly available to Sicomm, to which he never gets a reply. Based on the source code he becomes suspicious that Sicomm BASEC contains vulnerabilities and manages to confirm his suspicions in both the source code and the actual online service.

On 12 Feb 2022 he informs Sicomm support of the vulnerabilities, followed up by an email to an executive on 1 Oct 2022, but never hears back. On 1 Jan 2025 he hands over the case to DIVD CSIRT who validates his findings and tries to contact Sicomm too. An email to support on 14 Jan 2025, LinkedIn messages to several executives on 15 Jan 2025, another email to support on 22 Jan and a voice mail message to support on 26 Feb 2025 all go unanswered.

As per our [CNA policy](https://csirt.divd.nl/cna) we now consider Sicomm informed and have published this case file online. We have also sent Sicomm a full report of our findings. We have sent a copy of the report to CISA, because Sicomm claims BASEC is primarily used by US entities and we have seen evidence of this.

## What you can do

Sicomm BASEC is offered as a service, so the only party capable of fixing these issues is Sicomm. 

If you are currently a Sicomm BASEC customer or user:
* Reach out to Sicomm to address these issues and ask them to get in contact with `csirt (at) divd (dot) nl`
* Consider the information in and processes run via BASEC as compromised

## What we are doing

For now all we can do is publish this case file. If we do not hear back from Sicomm within the next 30 days we will do a limited disclosure of our findings and publish the CVEs.
