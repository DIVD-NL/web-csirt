## Summary

On behalf of [ENCS](https://encs.eu/), we disclosed a vulnerability to [Growatt](https://growatt.com). Due to an error in the authentication feature of the `plant transfer` function in the cloud platform of Growatt (either https://oss.growatt.com or https://server.growatt.com) failed to check authorisation when transfering an account from one account to another. A malicious users with a (free) installer account, could assign any plant to his account without this being noticable by the end user, effectively allowing this attacker to control and turn off any installation in the platform.

An attacker that is able to connect a significant number of plants with sufficient power and switches then at the right timing would potentially be able to disrupt the power grid.

## What you can do

The vulnerability is in the cloud services of the vendor. The vendor remediated the vulnerability by disabling the `plant transfer` functionallity. There is not action to be taken by the user.

## What we are doing

We have disclosed the vulnerability to the vendor who, once we established contact, took prompt action.
