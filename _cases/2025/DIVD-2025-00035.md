## Summary

Attackers are exploiting a new vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to secretly place a small backdoor on affected servers. When accessed, this backdoor reveals secret security keys that allow attackers to fully take over the system and bypass normal protections.

## What you can do

Check your SharePoint servers for suspicious files with unusual names, such as spinstall0.aspx, and monitor for strange responses when visiting unexpected pages. Make sure to apply the latest Microsoft security updates immediately to close the vulnerability. If you suspect that your server has been compromised, you should change all security keys and credentials, investigate for further unauthorized access, and consider restoring from a clean backup.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify parties that have been compromised by this vulnerability and are running a webshell.
