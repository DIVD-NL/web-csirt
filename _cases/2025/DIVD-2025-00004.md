## Summary

Due to confusion between the ngnix and apache web servers/proxies used to serve the PAN-OS web managmenet interface, it is possible to access certain PHP scripts on Palo Alto devices running PAN-OS without authentication as described in {% cve: CVE-2025-0108 %}. Running these scripts can lead to a compromise of the confidentiality and integrity of the device.

## What you can do

It is highly recommended not to publicly expose management interfaces of edge devices to the internet. This is also the case for PAN-OS device as per their [best practices deployment guidelines](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431).

* If you have the management interface of your PAN-OS device exposed to the internet, please restrict access to trusted IP addresses only.
* Install vendor supplied patches

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently scanning the internet for vulnerable devices. Once devices are identified we will warn the administrators of the networks they are located in.
