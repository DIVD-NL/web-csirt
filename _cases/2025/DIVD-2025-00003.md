## Summary

External research Wilco van Beijnum and DIVD researcher Harm van der Brik have identified multiple vulnerabilities in the Firmware of the Mennekes Premium Column charging station. These vulnerabilities allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands, read arbitrary files or execute SQL commands against the database of the charging station.
This firmware is common to all Mennekes Smart / Premium chargers.

These vulnerabilities are:
* {% cve 2025-22366 %} - An Authenticated Remote Command Execution in the firmware update interface, CVSS4.0: 8.7
* {% cve 2025-22367 %} - An Authenticated Remote Command Execution in the set time interface, CVSS4.0: 8.7
* {% cve 2025-22368 %} - An Authenticated Remote Command Execution in the SCU firmware update interface, CVSS4.0: 8.7
* {% cve 2025-22369 %} - An arbitrary file read vulnerability, CVSS4.0: 7.1
* {% cve 2025-22370 %} - Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the confiruration screens , CVSS4.0: 5.3


## What you can do

If you are the owner of or are responsible for the maintenance of such a charging station we recommend that you update the firmware to the latest version. You can download the firmware for the [Mennekes Software Updates page](https://www.mennekes.nl/emobility/service/software-updates/)

## What we are doing

We have responsibibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to Mennekes. We are investigating if it is possible to scan for these vulnerabilities remotely.
