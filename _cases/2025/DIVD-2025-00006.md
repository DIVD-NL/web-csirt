## Summary

CVE-2025-29927 is a critical vulnerability in Next.js that allows attackers to bypass middleware by exploiting the x-middleware-subrequest header. Updating to the latest version or stripping this header at the proxy level mitigates the risk.

## What you can do

To protect against this vulnerability, update Next.js to a patched version immediately. If updating isn’t possible, strip the x-middleware-subrequest header at the proxy or web server level.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently scanning the internet for vulnerable next.js applications with the given nuclei template, as applications have different designs the scan with this template could result in false positives. Once the applications are identified we will warn the administrators of the networks they are located in.
