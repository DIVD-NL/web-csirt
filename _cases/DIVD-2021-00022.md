## Summary

Microsoft Exchange has a number of vulnerabilities that allow a lot of opportunity for attack. Two of these attacks are ProxyShell, which allows Remote Code Execution and ProxyOracle which allows the recovery of the plain text password of a user by tricking them to click a single link.

We noticed that even tough patches have been released in April and July, there are still a lot of Exchange servers online without the patches.

## What you can do

If you run your own Exchange server, make sure it is patched:
* Exchange Server 2019 as least Cumulative update 9 or 10
* Exchange Server 2016 as least Cumulative update 20 or 21
* Exchange Server 2013 as least Cumulative update 23

If you are having trouble getting your Exchange server patched, we suggest that it might we worthwhile to look into Office 365.

## What we are doing

We have made an [NSE script for ProxyOracle](https://github.com/DIVD-NL/ProxyOracleNSE) available via out GitHub account. We are going to scan internet facing Exchange servers for ProxyOracle and ProxyShell (via [Kevin beaumont's script](https://github.com/GossiTheDog/scanning/blob/main/http-vuln-exchange-proxyshell.nse))
