## Summary
A DIVD researcher has identified three vulnerabilities in the [Kaseya Unitrends](https://www.unitrends.com/products/enterprise-backup-software) backup product.

Server software prior to v10.5.5-2 is vulnerable to:
* {% cve CVE-2021-40385 %}, a privilege escaltion vulnerability from read-only user to admin, and
* {% cve CVE-2021-40387 %}, an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability

Client software (any version) is currently vulnerable to: 
* {% cve CVE-2021-40386 %}, a (yet) upatched and undisclosed vulnerability on the client


## What you can do
Patch server software to at least version 10.5.5-2 to remove these vulnerabilities. As per Kaseya's [firewall requirements](https://support.unitrends.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013264518) you are strongly advised not to expose this product to public internet.

The client side vulnerability can current only be mitigated with firewall rules. Filter traffic to and from the client using the recommened mitigation from the [knowledge base article](https://support.unitrends.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404684084369-RCE-KB). 
 
## What we are doing
The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) performs a daily scan to detect vulnerable Kaseya Unitrends servers and notify the owners directly or via the known abuse channels, Gov-CERTs and CSIRTs, and other trusted channels.
