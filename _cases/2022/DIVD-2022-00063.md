## Summary

There is a memory overflow vulnerability in FortiOS SSL VPN which can be used to execute code on the system. There are multiple affected versions, and in Fortinet's [FG-IR-22-398 security bulletin](https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-22-398), Fortinet recommends to upgrade to one of the patched versions.


## What you can do

We advise you to upgrade your instance to one of the listed patched versions in Fortinet's [FG-IR-22-398 security bulletin](https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-22-398).

Patched version are:
* FortiOS version 7.2.3 or above
* FortiOS version 7.0.9 or above
* FortiOS version 6.4.11 or above
* FortiOS version 6.2.12 or above
* upcoming FortiOS-6K7K version 7.0.8 or above
* FortiOS-6K7K version 6.4.10 or above
* upcoming FortiOS-6K7K version 6.2.12 or above
* FortiOS-6K7K version 6.0.15 or above


## What we are doing

We have developed a partial fingerprinting method for FortiOS version v7.2.x. With this methode we are scanning the the internet to identify vulnerable instances. We will send notifcations to the owners of vulnerable systems we can fingerprint via the registered abuse contacts.

We will continue out investigating so see if we can remotely fingerprint other versions of these devices, or to find another safe way to determine if the device is vulnerable. When we are able to fingerprint FortiOS, we will include this in our scans so we are able to notify more owners of vulnerable systems.
