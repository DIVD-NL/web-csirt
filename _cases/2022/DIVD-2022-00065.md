## Summary

On February 15th 2022, [Sec Consult](https://sec-consult.com) published an [advisory](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Feb/37) regarding multiple vulnerabilities on various [Zyxel](https://zyxel.com) devices.
While some of these devices could be patched, others were EOL (end of life) and will not receive a patch. DIVD has performed scans for these devices, to notify owners/operators of the risks regarding the continued operation of these devices.

## What you can do

If you currently own or operate any of the listed EOL devices, please consider retiring/replacing it as soon as possible. If, for whatever reason, this is not a possibility, make sure all internet facing ports are closed as much as possible.

If you came here through other means than through our direct mailing, please refer to the [list published by Sec Consult and Zyxel](https://www.zyxel.com/global/en/support/security-advisories/zyxel-security-advisory-for-multiple-vulnerabilities-affected-model-list), to determine whether your Zyxel device is vulnerable and if a patch might be available, if your device isn't EOL. 

## What we are doing

After having notified all owners/operators of relevant EOL Zyxel devices, we will intermittently scan the internet, to determine if appropriate action has been taken, and renotify if we have not received a reply from a devices respective owner/operator.

At the first scan, we found 500 vulnerable IP addresses. A month later, a second scan showed 413 vulnerable IPs.
