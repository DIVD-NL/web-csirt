## Summary

The global energy transition is in full swing. It leads to a more distributed energy grid that is supported more and more by IT, OT and IoT.
We tought it was a good idea to keep track of all these cases in one place, but it didn't work out, we are closing this dossier.


## What we are doing

DIVD is using this dossier to track cases and findings that are related to this transition because we beleive this is an important topic.
