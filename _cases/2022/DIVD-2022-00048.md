## Summary

As the global energy transition is in full swing and it leads to a more distributed energy grid that is supported more and more by IT, OT and IoT we tough it was a good idea to track related events. However, this experiment has proven not to be practical, so we closed this dossier.

## What we are doing

This dossier is abandoned.
