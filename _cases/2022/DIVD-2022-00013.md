## Summary

In August 2022, during his investigation into exposed LDAP servers, DIVD researcher [Jan Los](https:/www.divd.nl/team/Jan+Los/) notices that secure LDAP servers (too) often use a certificate with the subject `www.update.microsoft.com`. Using Shodan and the query `ssl:"www.update.microsoft.com` it is dermined that at that point in time:

* 357 listening on the LDAP port use a certificate with this name
* 8180 listening on the HTTPS port use a certificate with this name

A second investigation on 27 Feb 2022 reveils that:
* 8588 ip addresses use a certificate with this name
* 8231 have the same SHA256 fingerprint: `1073570f79136511ba45b44c923a55c69b97e91d3aaa2e06e5e657129ca809ff`
* Only 6 servers actually return data:
  - 1 returns `forbidden`
  - 1 redirects to hxxps://fe2.update.microsoft.com/
  - 1 redirects to hxxps://www.update.microsoft.com/
  - 3 redirect to hxxps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq
  - These 6 servers seem to be legit.

Of the servers that have the `1073570f79136511ba45b44c923a55c69b97e91d3aaa2e06e5e657129ca809ff` fingerprint we kown the following:
* The server has the private key for the certificate
* The certificates are issued and signed by the `Microsoft Update CA`
* Modern windows versions have a certificate for this subCA and it's Root, but the rootCA's certificate expired in May 2021
* Apart for this expiration the certificate chain appears to be valid.

The certificate for www.update.microsoft.com, signed by the `Microsoft Update CA` has been the issue of security troubles in the past, given [this tweet from Mikko](https://twitter.com/mikko/status/214263127007690752) and on 18 June 2012 Microsoft had to regenerate the entire certificate chain, accoording to [this article by Eric Romang](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/06/18/update-microsoft-com-ssl-warnings-due-certificate-chain-update/).

### Conclusion

It is our conclusion that several thousands of servers that have the exact same certificate, and private key, associated with different ports cannot be good. The most likely scenatio is that we dealing with an infrastructure with criminal intent.

## What we are doing

We will reaching out to network owners aware of these servers in their network in the hope to find out more

## What you can do

For now, there is not much you can do.
