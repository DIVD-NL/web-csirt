## Summary

On 2 June 2022, Eye Security published a [blogpost](https://www.eye.security/blog/winrs-and-exchange-a-sneaky-backdoor) about a identified backdoor on earlier with ProxyLogon breached Server. The backdoor was found by their SOC after an alert of blocked Powershell execution on a Exchange Server. The backdoor was probably installed during or after the initial compromise via proxylogon or proxy shell and makes use of the WinRS service on the server to give a malicous actor with credentials remote access to the server.

## What you can do
Install the Microsoft Exchange patches.
Verify if the backdoor is available on your Microsoft Exchange server by using the following Powershell command:
winrs -r:https://yourexchangeserverurl/wsman whoami

If you receive the following error: "Winrs error: Access is denied." Then is your system probably has a backdoor installed by an malicious actor.

## What we are doing

We are currently working to identify the backdoors on Exchange Servers that are accessible from the internet and warn owners.
