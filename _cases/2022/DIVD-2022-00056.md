## Summary

An authentication bypass has been found in FortiOS, FortiProxy and FortiSwitchManager which may allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform administrative operations via HTTP(s) requests.

An attacker might be able to add new local users or upload a new public SSH key, to gain access to the Fortigate server.

There is a public exploit available and the vulnerability is easy to exploit.

## What you can do

We advise you to upgrade to FortiOS 7.0.7 or 7.2.2 or above, update FortiProxy 7.0.7 or 7.2.1 or above. If updating is not possible, disable the internet facing administration functionality.

If you were running a Fortigate instance with this version, after updating, please consider investigating if there are new -or unknown- public SSH-keys installed on the server. If after updating, an added SSH-key will remain installed. If possible and relevant for your instance, consider disallowing public access to SSH.

## What we are doing

We are actively scanning the internet for Fortigate instances that do not have the mitigations applied and will notify system owners via the listed abuse contacts.
