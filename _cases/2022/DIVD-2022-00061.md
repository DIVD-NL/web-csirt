## Summary

There is a command injection vulnerability in Bitbucket Server and Data Center that leverages environment variables execute code on the system. Atlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this vulnerability. There are multiple affected versions, and in their [Security Advisory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-and-data-center-security-advisory-2022-11-16-1180141667.html), Atlassian recommends to upgrade to one of the patched versions.

If upgrading is not possible, disabling the Public Signup option changes the attack vector from unauthenticated to authenticated. Doing so lowers the risk of exploitation. Bitbucket Server and Data Center instances running PostgreSQL are not affected. 

## What you can do

We advise you to upgrade your instance to one of the listed patched versions in the [Security Advisory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-and-data-center-security-advisory-2022-11-16-1180141667.html).
If doing so is not possible, disabling the Public Signup option temporarily narrows down the attack vector of the vulnerability.

## What we are doing

We are actively scanning the internet for Bitbucket instances that have not yet upgraded to a patched version and will notify system owners via the listed abuse contacts.
