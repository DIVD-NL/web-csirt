## Summary

When [Fox-IT](https://www.fox-it.com/) researcher [Yun Hu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunzhenghu/) read these two [security](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX463706/citrix-gateway-and-citrix-adc-security-bulletin-for-cve202227510-cve202227513-and-cve202227516)
* [Citrix security bulletin for CVE-2022-27518](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX474995) [bulletins](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX474995/citrix-adc-and-citrix-gateway-security-bulletin-for-cve202227518) from Citrix, he decided that it was time to start scanning the internet for Citrix servers vulnerable to {% cve cve-2022-27510 %} and (later) {% cve 2022-27518 %}. And he has published a very nice [blog post](https://blog.fox-it.com/2022/12/28/cve-2022-27510-cve-2022-27518-measuring-citrix-adc-gateway-version-adoption-on-the-internet/).

Early Jan 2023, Fox-IT and DIVD agreed to cooperate and share data so that DIVD could warn the owners of vulnerable systems.

These two of CVEs are critical. 

### {% cve CVE-2022-27510 %} - Unauthorized access to Gateway user capabilities

This vulnerability leaves your appliance open to being taken over remotely by an attacker if it is "operating as a Gateway (SSL VPN, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy)"

### {% cve 2022-27518 %}  - Unauthenticated remote arbitrary code execution

This vulnerability allows an attacker to take over an appliance if it is configured as a SAML Service Provider or SAML Identity Provider.



## What you can do

If your Citrix server hasn't been updated to a secure version, we strongly advise you to patch it, especially if you're utilizing any of the following features:
* SSL VPN
* ICA Proxy
* CVPN
* RDP Proxy
* SAML (Either service provider or Identity provider)

If you are not using one of these servers we still recommend that you patch to a non-vulnerable version to prevent that your appliance becomes vulnerable when you start using one of these functions in the future.


## What we are doing

Fox-IT has shared lists with vulnerable systems on a regular basis, and DIVD has sent out notifications to owners of vulnerable systems.

We did this over a timespam of three months.

We stopped notifying system owners after this time.
