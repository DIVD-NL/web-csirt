## Summary

DIVD is currently scanning the Internet for commonly known malicious webshells. These webshells often serve as an initial access method and/or persistency measure for malicious actors and are usually exposed to the Internet. DIVD is researching ways to identify these webshells and notifying the owners of compromised servers.

## What you can do

Remove the files associated to the webshell from your server and investigate your infrastructure for malicious activity.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify vulnerable parties and notifying these. We do this by scanning for paths that are commonly known to contain webshells and examining these pages to determine whether they are malicious. Owners of vulnerable instances receive a notification with the host information and remediation steps.
