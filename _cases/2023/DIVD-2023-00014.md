## Summary

Several Jira Service Management versions between 5.3.0 and 5.5.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an attacker to impersonate another user and gain access under certain circumstances. Especially vulnerable are bot accounts, as well as instances using SSO, where anyone can create their own account.

## What you can do

Update your Jira Service Management Server and Data Center to one of the patched versions mentioned earlier in this case file to mitigate the vulnerability.

## What we are doing

After creating a fingerprint, we started scanning the internet for possibly compromised servers.

From the data we gathered, we concluded there were no vulnerable servers directly accessible from the internet.
