## Summary

Recently, a writeup was posted for the open source tool, Apache Superset. This is an exploration and visualization tool. The vulnerability lies with SECRET_KEY that signs the cookies of user logging in. By default, this key is one of 5 standard keys, which as written in the documentation needs to be changed by a randomly generated value. But since no one reads the documentation anymore, not a lot of people change this value. This key is very important since it signs the cookies, and when an attacker knows this key, they can sign their own cookies. With the results that an attacker can forge his own (non privileged) cookies to log in as an administrator. 







## What you can do

* Consider upgrading to the latest version.
* Rotate the SECRET_KEY by following the article on Apache on their website: https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/configuring-superset .

## What we are doing

* DIVD is currently pinpointing all the vulnerable Superset servers.
