## Summary

IBM Aspera Faspex 4.4.2 Patch Level 1 and earlier could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a YAML deserialization flaw. By sending a specially crafted obsolete API call, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.

## What you can do

Update your Aspera Faspex instance to 4.4.2 Patch Level 2 to mitigate the vulnerability.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify vulnerable parties and notifying these. We do this by finding Aspera Faspex instances and verifying their version.
