## Summary

A vulnerability has been discovered in Ivanti Sentry, formerly MobileIron Sentry. The vulnerability impacts all supported versions up until version 9.18. If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthenticated attacker to access sensitive API endpoints that are used to configure Ivanti Sentry on the administrator portal. The risk can be mitigated by limiting access to port 8443 and installing the provided RPM scripts in the Security Advisory. This vulnerability is actively being exploited and therefore mitigation should be done as soon as possible.

## Recommendations

Limit access to port 8443 on the administrator portal (known as MICS) and install the Ivanti-provided RPM scripts to mitigate the problem.

## What we are doing

DIVD is scanning for vulnerable systems. Owners of such systems will receive a notification with this casefile and remediation steps.
