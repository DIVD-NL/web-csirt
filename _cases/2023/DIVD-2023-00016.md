## Summary

On September 14, 2022, a new 0-day vulnerability came out in GLPI and was posted online. GLPI is an open source IT asset management software which is widely used. The vulnerability involves a code injection in GLPI instances versions < 10.0.3 and < 9.5.9 which results in a remote code execution vulnerability, caused by an old version of the htmlawed library (under /vendor/htmlawed/htmlawed/) that still contains the htmLawedTest.php file with code injection vulnerability.

## What you can do

* Consider upgrading to the latest version.
* Delete the vendor/htmlawed/htmlawed/htmLawedTest.php file (be careful not to touch the htmLawed.php file which is legitimate). Or prevent web access to the vendor/ folder by setting (in the case of Apache, for example) an adequate .htaccess.

## What we are doing

* DIVD is currently pin-pointing, all the vulnerable GLPI servers.
* DIVD is investigating if we can start informing the owners of vulnerable GLPI servers.
* DIVD started scanning for vulnerable instances.
