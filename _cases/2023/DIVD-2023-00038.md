## Summary

On October 16th, Cisco disclosed an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting Cisco IOS-XE appliances with CVE-ID CVE-2023-20198. An unknown threat actor is actively placing implants on the vulnerable appliances worldwide. This is a serious situation as implants allow threat actors to monitor traffic, gain access to the underlying system and move into protected networks. For additional guidance, please find the Cisco PSIRT advisory at the bottom of this page.

## Recommendations

Given that no patch is yet available, disable HTTP(S) access to any management interfaces if possible. If HTTP(S) access is required, implement an Access Control List to limit access.
If your appliance contains an implant, the steps to remediate are rebooting the appliance to neutralize the implant, disabling http(s)-server and removing any privileged accounts in that order.

## What we are doing

DIVD is scanning for implants on public-facing systems. Owners of such systems will receive a notification with this casefile and remediation steps.
