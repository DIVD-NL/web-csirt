## Summary

GeoServer located a vulnerability in the GeoTools Library that allows SQL Injection using OGC Filter and Function expressions. A POC is available.

## What you can do

GeoServer advises to install the patch by upgrading to version 2.23.0. If this is not possible, there are a few mitigations available which include disabling the PostGIS Datastore encode functions to mitigate the vulnerabilities in the `strStartsWith` and `strEndsWith` parameters and enabling the PostGIS DataStore preparedStatements functionality to mitigate the `FeatureId` vulnerability. Note that these mitigations are known to cause significant slowdowns.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify vulnerable parties and notifying these. We do this by finding GeoServer instances and extracting the version name. Vulnerable parties will receive a notification with remediation steps.
