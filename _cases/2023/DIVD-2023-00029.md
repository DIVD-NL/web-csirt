## Summary
Following previous incident FG-IR-22-398 / CVE-2022-42475 published on January 11, 2023 (known to us as DIVD-2022-00063) where a heap-based buffer overflow in FortiOS SSL VPN with exploitation was observed in the wild, the Fortinet Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) proactively initiated a code audit of the SSL-VPN module. This audit, together with a responsible disclosure from a third-party researcher, led to the identification of this new critical SSL-VPN RCE Vulnerability.
According to a blog, posted by BishopFox, there were nearly 490,000 affected SSL VPN interfaces exposed on the internet on June 30th of 2023. Roughly 69% of them were at that time unpatched.
## What you can do
Upgrade your SSL VPN instance to the latest version or apply the work-around: disable SSL VPN or only allow whitelisted IPs.

## What we are doing
DIVD is currently scanning for vulnerable instances connected to the public internet. We would like to thank Fox-IT / NCC Group for the data on this vulnerability that we will use to notify owners of vulnerable systems. Owners of vulnerable systems will receive a notification with instructions to update their system.
