## Summary

Prior to MinIO version RELEASE.2023-03-020T20-16-18Z, an attacker can use crafted requests to bypass metadata bucket name checking and put an object into any bucket while processing `PostPolicyBucket`. To carry out this attack, the attacker requires credentials with `arn:aws:s3:::*` permission, as well as enabled Console API access. This issue has been patched in RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z. As a workaround, enable browser API access and turn off `MINIO_BROWSER=off`.

## Recommendations

Install the patched version of RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z or apply the workaround by enabling browser API access and turning off `MINIO_BROWSER`.
