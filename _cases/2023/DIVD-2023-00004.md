## Summary

An unauthenticated Remote Command Execution vulnerability has been identified in Zoho ManageEngine. It is registered as CVE-2022-47966 and stems from an outdated Apache Santuario implementation. If SAML has been enabled to facilitate Single Sign-On (SSO), malicious actors can execute arbitrary code on ManageEngine instances by sending a malicious SAML response to the server.

## What you can do

Update your ManageEngine instance to the next version after the mentioned vulnerable versions.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify vulnerable parties and notifying these. We do this by finding ManageEngine instances with reachable SAMLResponseServlets and verifying their version.
