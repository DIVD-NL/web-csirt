## Summary

Improper error message handling in some firewall versions could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute some OS commands remotely by sending crafted packets to an affected device.

## What you can do

If the product is still under support, update to the latest version. For ZyWALL/USG this is version ZLD V4.73 Patch 1 and all other products this is version ZLD V5.36.

## What we are doing

DIVD is currently working to identify vulnerable parties and notifying these. We do this by finding Zyxel instances and checking their version and product name. The notificaiton will be sent to the party responsible for the ip address according to the whois database.
