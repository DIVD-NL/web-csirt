## Summary

On 2 June 2022, Volexity published a [report about an exploitation of Confluence](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/02/zero-day-exploitation-of-atlassian-confluence/). 
Volexity has been in contact with Atlassian who released a formal advisory.

What we know so far:
* Affected products are Confluence Server and Confluence Datacenter (both on-premise products)
* All versions released after 1.3.5 have been confirmed to be vulnerable too
* The vulnerability is an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
* The proof of concept for exploitation is publicly available
* Patches are available

Atlassian has released a patch, see [their security advisory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2022-06-02-1130377146.html) for details.
Patched versions are:
```
- 7.4.17
- 7.13.7
- 7.14.3
- 7.15.2
- 7.16.4
- 7.17.4
- 7.18.1
```

## What you can do

Apply the patch released by Atlassian.

If patching is not an option, you can follow the advice underneath to mitigate risks.

If you are using Confluence Server or Data Center it is recommended that you either:
* Severely restrict access, or
* Disable the service

If that is unfeasible, a WAF that blocks requests containing `${` may provide additional protection, but there is still a severe risk.

## What we are doing

We started scanning before the exploit was publicly available, by matching the version numbers of the identified instances.
We are currently working to identify unpatched Confluence instances that are accessible from the internet and warn owners.

as of June 16, we started scanning with a non-intrusive command execution.

We will be sharing the Dutch part of the data with the [Dutch Digital Trust Center](https://www.digitaltrustcenter.nl/dreigingsinformatie-ontvangen) who will inform affected Dutch companies
