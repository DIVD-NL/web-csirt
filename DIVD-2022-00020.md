## Summary

DIVD researcher Wietse Boonstra discovered five vulnerabilities in OSNEXUS QuantaStor. These vulnerabilities included a Server-Side Request Forgery, Remote Command Execution, Privilege Escalation and two Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. Use of these vulnerabilities could lead to the compromise of your Bitbucket server.

## Impact

By leveraging these vulnerabilities, an attacker could execute code on the webpage, make requests on the server's behalf and gain root privilege on the server, potentially leading to total compromise of the environment.
