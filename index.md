## The DIVD CSIRT...

... supports the [Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure](https://divd.nl), in its mission “…to make the digital world safer by reporting vulnerabilities we find in digital systems to the people who can fix them. We have a global reach, but do it Dutch style: open, honest, collaborative, and for free.”

The CSIRT handles the scanning for and disclosing of vulnerabilities, either discovered by DIVD researchers or third parties and warning people for leaked credentials.
